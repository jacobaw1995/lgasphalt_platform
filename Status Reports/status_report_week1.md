# LG Asphalt Project Management Platform - Week 1 Status Report
**Date**: May 6, 2025  
**Prepared for**: Controller  
**Project**: Web-based project management platform for LG Asphalt

## Overview
Week 1 (May 1-6, 2025) focused on setting up the development environment and implementing core authentication for the admin backend. All tasks were completed on schedule, establishing a solid foundation for the platform using free tools, as per the project scope.

## Completed Tasks
- **May 1: Environment Setup**
  - Installed Python 3.13.3, Git 2.49.0, and VS Code.
  - Created project directory (`lgasphalt_platform`) with Git repository, `.gitignore`, and `README.md`.
  - Set up virtual environment (`venv`).
- **May 2: Install Dependencies, Test `app.py`**
  - Installed `flask`, `flask-login`, `flask-bcrypt`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`.
  - Created `app.py` with a basic Flask app, tested at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
- **May 3: Database Initialization**
  - Created `init_db.py` to initialize `crm.db` (SQLite).
  - Set up tables: `users`, `customers`, `projects`, `tasks`, `equipment`, `photos`, `forms`, `project_finances`.
  - Verified database creation.
- **May 4: Add Admin Users, Test Login**
  - Created `add_users.py` to add three admin users (`admin1`, `admin2`, `admin3`) with hashed passwords.
  - Implemented login system with Flask-Login and Flask-Bcrypt.
  - Tested login, protected `/pm` route, and logout functionality.
- **May 5: Add `login.html`, Test Login**
  - Created `templates/login.html` with Bootstrap, styled with LG Asphalt colors (black, yellow, light gray, dark gray).
  - Updated `app.py` to render `login.html`.
  - Tested login form with valid and invalid credentials.
- **May 6: Test `dashboard.html`**
  - Created `templates/dashboard.html` for the admin backend, styled with Bootstrap and LG Asphalt branding.
  - Updated `/pm` route to render `dashboard.html`.
  - Tested dashboard access after login, including logout.

## Current Functionality
- **Authentication**: Admin users can log in at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login` with secure password hashing. The `/pm` route is protected, accessible only after login, and displays a styled dashboard.
- **Branding**: Login and dashboard pages use LG Asphalt colors (black `#000000`, yellow `#FFC107`, light gray `#F5F5IVO5`, dark gray `#333333`).
- **Database**: `crm.db` is initialized with all required tables, ready for customer and project data.
- **Codebase**: All changes are committed to Git, with a clean repository.

## Next Steps
- **Week 2 (May 8-14)**: Begin core features, starting with customer management (`add_customer.html`) and project management (`add_project.html`, Gantt charts).
- Continue adhering to free tools, modular design, and project timeline (functional app by May 31, 2025).

## Notes
- All tasks used free tools (Python, SQLite, Flask, Bootstrap), meeting budget constraints.
- The platform is on track for local deployment (Render/Heroku planned for May 30).
- No issues encountered; ready to proceed to Week 2.
